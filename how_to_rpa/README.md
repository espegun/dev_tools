# How to RPA

## The purpose
There are several RPA libraries for Python, but looking at [this](https://research.aimultiple.com/python-rpa/) in March 2021, you clearly want to use the one from Robot FrameWork Foundation.
An (unexplored) alternative is UiPath.

## How does it work?

## Useful commands
You may install the entire rpaframework or just Selenium (browser automation). Selenium is mostly meant for testing, but can be used for any browser automation.  
`$ pip install rpaframework`  
`$ pip install selenium`  
Se examples (using the full rpaframework).

## You may also deploy this on an EC2 instance
[Selenium and Chrome on an EC2 instance](https://praneeth-kandula.medium.com/running-python-scripts-on-an-aws-ec2-instance-8c01f9ee7b2f)  
`$ sudo yum install libX11` You may also have to install this if the chromedriver version can't be found.
